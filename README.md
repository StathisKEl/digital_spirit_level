# digital_spirit_level
A digital spirit level based on the Arduino Uno Rev3 development board.

With the help of this device any object can be placed in any angle ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees on a flat surface (reference plane). In order to achieve the desire placement of the object on the reference plane the digital spirit level must be first placed on the reference plane until the value of each angle becomes zero (x_a is the angle that corresponds to the X axis and y_a is the angle that corresponds to the Y axis). Then the user can use the digital spirit level for adjusting the angle between the object and the reference plane that corresponds to one of the two axis (axis X and axis Y).   

The code inside the spirit_level_code.ino file is under the GNU General Public v3.0 license and the hardware of the digital spirit level is under the CERN Open Hardware Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal license.
